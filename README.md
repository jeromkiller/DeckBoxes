# DeckBoxes
A deckbox design based off [u/MidnightLightning's](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/hw9m6j/packvelopes_diy_papercraft_reusable_storage_for/) design.

Altered to fit roughly 21 trading cards without sleeves.
Cut allong the black lines and score the stippled lines.

Optionally score the underside of flap to make opening the box slightly easier
